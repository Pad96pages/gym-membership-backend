# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Membership App

A **full-stack web application** to manage gym memberships, bookings, and user interactions.  
This project builds upon my earlier [Gym Membership Backend](https://github.com/Pad96pages/gym-membership-backend) project.  

👉 First, I implemented the backend APIs and database integration.  
👉 Then, I expanded it into a **complete full-stack app** with frontend + backend + database.
